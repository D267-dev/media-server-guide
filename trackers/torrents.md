#### Introduction
For Torrents, it's advisable to start with public trackers and slowly move to private trackers, if that is something you're interested in. Please be aware that uploading (sharing) copyright content is illegal in many countries. Please do not break the law.

Additionally, bittorrent can take quite the strain on your home network. This shouldn't be much of a problem if you limit the bandwidth and maximum connections. When not using a seedbox, you can usually make up ratio by seeding long term. If you have storage available, why limit your seeding time? Sonarr and Radarr will let you watch content while it's still being seeded. Even keeping it up for years shouldn't be an issue. Having a VPN provider that supports port fowarding or simply not using a VPN and activating port forwarding in your router can help greatly too.

Torrents are all about giving back what you take, so please consider that. While it is possible to primarily use public trackers, where sharing back isn't being enforced, it's not really in the spirit of torrents and this guide. However, if you're just looking to get started or are looking to build based on what you already have with the intention of moving on as you learn, you'll be able to get by this way. Maybe come back here to take another look once you've found the limits of the quick and easy solution. 

If you don't care about any of that and just want a VPN, [VPNSecure.me lifetime licenses](https://stacksocial.com/sales/vpn-secure-online-privacy-subscriptions) are $40 pretty much all the time. There is no cheaper VPN if you don't care much about features and security but just want to run your traffic encrypted through a different country. No port forwarding available.

#### Journey
For private trackers, I recommend you do the interview for MAM, unlock their [invite forums](https://github.com/PredictablePirate/TrackerInviteThreads) and get yourself an invite to DigitalCore and Aither. As always, do your own research. Prowlarr helps you set up ratios and seed times according to each tracker's requirements, although seeding as long as you can manage is advisable.

If you don't know where to get started at all - popular public trackers are 1337x, AnimeTosho, Nyaa.si, EZTV, kickasstorrents, RuTracker, YTS, Extra Torrents and TorrentGalaxy.
All of these are supported by **Prowlarr**. You may set them up and forget about it. **Just make sure to set Seed Ratio to 1 and Seed Time to at least a week, so you give back what you take.**

Please refer to Prowlarr's official documentation, if you have trouble setting any of them up.
