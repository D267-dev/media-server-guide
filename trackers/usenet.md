For Usenet, I recommend joing the relevant subreddit(s) and asking what people use. NZBGeek and DrunkenSlug seem to be the most popular. Keep in mind, they all cost money and some only open up their registration for short periods of time a few times a year. 

This isn't within the spirit of this tutorial at all. Therefore I won't go into it further.
I will, however, leave you with [Eweka's "special" deal](https://www.eweka.nl/en/landing/unlimited-usenet-special) that's pretty much up all the time and gets you a good price on Usenet servers.
